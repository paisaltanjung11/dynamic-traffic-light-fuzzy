# Dynamic AI-Powered Traffic Lights for Pedestrian Crossings  

An intelligent traffic light system leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize pedestrian safety and crossing efficiency. Built with fuzzy logic, real-time data integration, and a user-friendly interface, this project is designed to address the challenges of traffic management in urban environments.

## Overview

The **Dynamic AI-Powered Traffic Lights** project aims to develop a responsive system that dynamically adjusts traffic light durations for pedestrians based on real-time conditions. By integrating fuzzy logic with APIs like TomTom Traffic and OpenCage Geocoding, the system enhances urban mobility, reduces pedestrian waiting times, and promotes adherence to traffic rules.

### Objectives:
1. **Optimize Pedestrian Crossing Durations**: Adjust traffic light timings dynamically to minimize waiting time.
2. **Enhance Safety**: Reduce accident risks by ensuring sufficient crossing times.
3. **Support Sustainable Cities**: Contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 11 by promoting efficient and pedestrian-friendly traffic systems.

## Features

- **Adaptive Fuzzy Logic**  
  Implements a fuzzy inference system to adjust traffic light durations based on:
  - Number of pedestrians.
  - Vehicle speed.
  - Road width.
  - Time of day.

- **Real-Time Traffic Data Integration**  
  Utilizes TomTom Traffic API to collect live traffic conditions, including vehicle speed and congestion levels.

- **Interactive User Interface**  
  Built with Streamlit to allow users to test and simulate the system:
  - Automatic mode (GPS-based).
  - Manual mode (customizable input parameters).

- **Scalable and Modular Design**  
  The system can be expanded with additional sensors and historical data for enhanced performance.

   - Vehicle speed and congestion data (via TomTom API).  
   - Time of day.  
   - Road width (manual configuration).  

2. **Processing**:
   - Fuzzy logic system processes input data to determine optimal light durations.  

3. **Output**:
   - Dynamic green light durations tailored to current traffic conditions.  

4. **Interface**:
   - Displays real-time traffic conditions and recommended crossing durations.

As the Team Leader, I was responsible for overseeing the entire project lifecycle, ensuring its successful execution from start to finish. My contributions included designing and modeling the system architecture to ensure scalability and efficiency, as well as developing the prototype and implementing the system to translate theoretical designs into a functional application. I conducted rigorous system testing to identify and address issues, ensuring the solution met both performance and quality standards. Post-implementation, I evaluated the system and introduced refinements for continuous improvement. Additionally, I coordinated the teamâ€™s efforts to ensure all project milestones were met on schedule, provided technical and strategic guidance to foster collaboration and innovation among team members, and assisted in debugging and optimizing the system to enhance its functionality and user experience.
